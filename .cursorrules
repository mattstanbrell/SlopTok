// IMPORTANT: Never create new files for Firebase rules
// Instead, output them directly in the conversation for easy copy/paste into the Firebase console
// This is because Firebase rules need to be manually updated in the Firebase Console UI

// IMPORTANT: Even though we store things in "videos/" and have video-related naming,
// we are currently only generating static images that get converted to 3-second videos.
// All LLM prompts should refer to "images" not "videos" and avoid video-specific language.
