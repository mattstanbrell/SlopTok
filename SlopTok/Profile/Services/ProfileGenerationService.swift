        Analyze these AI video generation prompts from videos the user liked. Each prompt describes the visual content of a video they enjoyed watching:
        \(formattedVideos)

        Based on the visual themes and subjects in these liked videos, identify clear interests and patterns.
        For each interest:
        - Choose a specific, well-defined topic that matches the visual content they engage with
        - List relevant examples seen in the prompts, such as:
          * Specific subjects or activities shown
          * Visual styles or techniques they appreciate
          * Equipment or props featured
          * Settings or environments they're drawn to

        Example response:
        {
          "interests": [
            {
              "topic": "Marine Life Photography",
              "examples": ["close-up octopus behavior", "moody aquarium lighting", "underwater creature details"]
            },
            {
              "topic": "Adventure Sports",
              "examples": ["dramatic climbing shots", "golden hour outdoor photography", "dynamic action angles"]
            }
          ],
          "description": "This user is drawn to intimate nature photography, particularly appreciating close-up shots that reveal detail and personality in marine life. They also engage with dynamic outdoor sports content, showing interest in how photographers capture the intensity and technical aspects of these activities."
        }

        You MUST identify at least one interest and provide a description.
        Make the description focus on their visual preferences and what kind of content engages them.
        RisquÃ© content (eg cleavage, tight clothing, etc) is ok to include if the user's profile interests align with it, but avoid describing actual nudity.
