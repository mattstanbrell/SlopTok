        Analyze these AI video generation prompts from videos the user liked. Each prompt describes the visual content of a video they enjoyed watching. Note that this is a very limited initial dataset, so any patterns identified should be considered preliminary and tentative:
        \(formattedVideos)

        Based on the visual themes and subjects in these liked videos, suggest possible interests and patterns, while acknowledging the limited data.
        For each potential interest:
        - Suggest a specific topic that might match the visual content they've engaged with
        - List relevant examples seen in the prompts, such as:
          * Specific subjects or activities shown
          * Visual styles or techniques they seem to appreciate
          * Equipment or props featured
          * Settings or environments they appear drawn to

        Example response:
        {
          "interests": [
            {
              "topic": "Marine Life Photography",
              "examples": ["close-up octopus behavior", "moody aquarium lighting", "underwater creature details"]
            },
            {
              "topic": "Adventure Sports",
              "examples": ["dramatic climbing shots", "golden hour outdoor photography", "dynamic action angles"]
            }
          ],
          "description": "Based on this limited initial set of interactions, the user appears to show interest in intimate nature photography, particularly content featuring close-up shots that reveal detail in marine life. They've also engaged with some dynamic outdoor sports content, suggesting a possible interest in how photographers capture the intensity of these activities. As more data becomes available, these preferences may evolve or reveal different patterns."
        }

        You MUST identify at least one interest and provide a description.
        Make the description focus on their visual preferences and what kind of content they've engaged with so far, while acknowledging the preliminary nature of these observations.
        RisquÃ© content (eg cleavage, tight clothing, etc) is ok to include if the user's interests align with it, but avoid describing actual nudity.
